# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to the GPS my main struggle was with uderstanding branching and merging. When do I need to create a new branch and merge the branch back to master. I also was a bit confused about whether I should delete a branch after merging.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
During the GPS I was able to understand better when I should create a branch. It seemed like that we were constantly making new branches throughout the challenge whenever we were doing something new (e.g. adding new file).

The Git workflow was clarified: add, commit, push. As well has how Pull Requests are created when pushing branches to a collaborative GitHub repo. We also learned about the concept of origin as the alias for the GitHub repo site location.

I also think I understand the git fetch command better. We had a discussion during GPS and I think it used to compare the origin to the local master prior to merging it with the local master. It seems like the pull request command to check what is going to be changed prior to merging.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What does origin mean? What is fetch?

# What still confuses you about Git?
What is the best way to keep everything synced between the different machines? For example having different branches on machine verses GitHub. What are the +++ and --- and @@@ signs in the terminal when we run diff? How should we be reading the terminal output?

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was fun! I liked my partner. She was very thorough and was pleasant to work with. I was very impressed by her skills as a Navigator. During the next challange I hope to be as clear she was.

Our guide Daniel Deutsch was also great to work with. He kept his distance and let us work through the challenge but was extremely helpful when we needed him.He also gave excellent feedback.
